# Gemini3 Development Tasks & Ideation

## Core Tasks
- [x] Initialize React + TypeScript + Tailwind environment.
- [x] Implement React Three Fiber (R3F) for the 3D Globe Matrix.
- [x] Integrate `@google/genai` SDK for the AI Kernel.
- [x] Create Virtual File System (VFS) state management.
- [ ] Implement Real-time Audio/Video generation (Veo/Imagen integration placeholders).
- [ ] Add OAuth/MCP simulation for external data providers.

## Discovery Questions (Ideation Phase)
To further evolve the "Gemini3" concept into the unique application described, consider these questions:

1. **The Data "Soul":** You mentioned visualizing user data as a connected bubble map. Should the AI purely *observe* this data, or should it proactively *restructure* the data nodes based on semantic similarity (clustering similar files/ideas together physically in the 3D space)?
2. **The "OS" Boundaries:** Should this "OS" be ephemeral (resetting on reload) or should we implement a persistent browser-based database (IndexedDB) so the "world" grows permanently as you interact with it?
3. **The Creative Engine:** When you say "software generation," do you envision the AI generating code snippets for you to read, or do you want the app to attempt to *execute* simple Javascript modules within a sandboxed environment inside the 3D world?
